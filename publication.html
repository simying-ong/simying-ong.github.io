	<p class="abstract">Abstract: <i>This paper proposes an information hiding method to embed data while executing image enhancement steps. The 2D Median Filter is adapted and re-engineered to demonstrate the feasibility of this concept. In particular, the filtering-embedding steps are performed for each pixel in a sliding window manner. Pixels enclosed within the predefined window (neighborhood) are gathered, linearized and sorted. Then, the linearized pixels are divided into partitions, in which each partition is assigned to represent a certain sequence of bits. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated by using the BSD300 dataset for various settings. The embedding capacity, image quality, data extraction error rate are reported and analyzed. Besides, the robustness of the proposed method against brute force attack is also discussed. In the best case scenario, when the window size is 7×7,∼0.97 bpp is achieved with acceptable image quality while having ∼3.5% data extraction error rate.</i></p>

	<p class="abstract">Abstract: <i>The heavy-tailed properties of modulation transfer function (MTF) typically introduce noise and an aliasing effect in the MTF compensation (MTFC) effort to improve the spatial quality of optical satellite images. These degradative effects compromise the image’s signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Consequently, users must evaluate the relative importance of image sharpness versus SNR for their applications to decide whether MTFC processing is appropriate. We propose a high-fidelity MTFC method that executes an optimal trade-off between noise regularization and detail preservation in the image restoration process to address this problem. To this end, we exploit the merit of image prior characteristics in both local smoothness and nonlocal self-similarity properties of an image in a hybrid domain (viz., space spatial and frequency) to design effective regularization terms that reflect these image properties. Furthermore, we establish a simple joint statistical model in the curvelet domain to combine these two properties. To make this regularization-based MTFC method tractable and robust, we employ the multiobjective bilevel optimization approach to solve the severely ill-posed inverse problem of MTFC. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the proposed regularization-based MTFC method using synthetically blurred images simulated from the level 2A product of IKONOS and real satellite images with unknown blur. Quantitative measurements of image quality reveal that the proposed method produces competitive restoration results with minimum computational complexity and exhibits a good convergence property. These experimental results show that the proposed method can find a compromise between regularizing noise and preserving image fidelity.</i></p>

	<p class="abstract">Abstract: <i>One practical way to characterize the spatial performance of an in-flight satellite optical imaging system is to determine the modulation transfer function (MTF) from its remotely sensed images on the ground. Currently, there are many MTF measurement techniques designed to provide accurate measurements for high-resolution imaging systems. However, these existing techniques usually rely on the presence and manual identification of a well-separated characteristics target. We introduce an insight to effectively estimate a degradation function based on the MTF by analyzing the nonlocal self-similarity characteristics, namely the structural component, in the observed image. To this end, this paper presents several strategies to realize the aim of this work. First, we propose a segmentation method to select the ideal candidates for MTF estimation. Second, we develop an adaptive structure selection method that removes detrimental structures and selects useful information for point spread function (PSF) estimation. Finally, we put forward a robust estimation method by introducing a spatial prior that is able to simultaneously suppress noises while preserving the sparsity and continuity of the PSF kernels. For the experiments, datasets used in the analyses are synthetically blurred images simulated from level 2A product of IKONOS and real remotely sensed images from level 0 product of RazakSAT. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is practical and effective, with &lt;2.3% of relative error at the Nyquist frequency as compared to the well-established edge method. This indicates that the proposed method can warrant a reliable result for on-orbit spatial characterization.</i></p>

	<p class="abstract">Abstract: <i>High dynamic range (HDR) image allows more details to be seen in a digital image, where objects in the darker (e.g., shadow) and brighter (e.g., sky) regions are made more visible. Therefore, there is an increasing number of devices that include the HDR imaging capturing capability. In this work, a method is put forward to encrypt high dynamic range image encoded in the JPEG XT standard. To achieve diffusion, DC coefficients in the base layer are shuffled in groups of variable sizes. Similarly, AC coefficients in the base and residual layers are shuffled in the form of (zero-run-size, value) pair. Our encryption method is able to achieve: (a) suppression of bit stream size expansion, (b) sufficiently mask the visual appearance of an HDR image, and (c) format-compliant. Experiments are carried out to verify the basic performance of the proposed method. In the best case scenario, an HDR image can be completely distorted to mask its perceptual semantics with slightly reduced file size.</i></p>

	<p class="abstract">Abstract: <i>A JPEG XT format-compliant data embedding method is put forward by exploiting the natural relationship of coefficient count in the base and residual layers. Specifically, the number of coefficients for each MCU in the base layer is often larger than that of the respective MCU in the residual layer. This happens when the quality factor of the base layer is ≥ 75 and the quality factor of the residual layer is lower than that of the base layer. The proposed method then swaps the MCUs within these two layers to embed data. In case when a MCU is indistinguishable, a marker is injected to explicitly mark this bad MCU. When only AC coefficients are swapped, the output image quality can be maintained with some expansion of bit stream size. On the other hand, when both DC and AC coefficients are swapped, the proposed method is able to generate a fully distorted output image, hence masking the perceptual semantic of the image. Experiments are carried out to evaluate the performance of the proposed data embedding method.</i></p>

	<p class="abstract">Abstract: <i>A separable encryption and data insertion method is proposed in this paper. The input image is divided into 2 parts, where the first part is manipulated to mask the perceptual semantics, while the second part is processed to hide data. The binary image, which is the data to be inserted, further divides the second part of the input image into 2 regions called the `zero' and `one' regions. Pixels of the original image at position coinciding with the `zero' region are darken, while those coinciding with the `one' region are brightened. The darkening and brightening processes are performed by using histogram matching technique. The proposed joint method is separable, where the inserted binary image can be extracted directly from the masked image or from the reconstructed image. The proposed method is also commutative because the same results is achieved irregardless of the order of processing in encrypting and inserting data.

	<p class="abstract">Abstract: <i>The advancement of cryptography and cryptanalysis has driven numerous innovations over years. Among them is the treatment of cryptanalysis on selectively encrypted content as a recovery problem. Recent research has shown that linear programming is a powerful tool to recover unknown coefficients in DCT-transformed images. While the time complexity is polynomial, it is still too high for large images so faster methods are still desired. In this paper, we propose a fast hierarchical DCT coefficients recovery method by combining image segmentation and linear programming. In theory the proposed method can reduce the overall time complexity by a linear factor which is the number of image segments used. Our experimental results showed that, for 100 test images of different sizes and using a naive image segmentation method based on Otsu’s thresholding algorithm, the proposed method is faster for more than 92% cases and the maximum improvement observed is more than 19 times faster. While being mostly faster, results also showed that the proposed method can roughly maintain the visual quality of recovered images in both objective and subjective terms.</i></p>

	<p class="abstract">Abstract: <i>This paper proposes a data insertion method using DCT coefficient prediction algorithm in encrypted JPEG image. First, a sequence of quantized AC coefficients are removed, and the remaining nonzero coefficients are shifted to the left, hence ensuring sufficient room for data insertion. Next, the external data is mapped to a set of Huffman codewords, and the external data is inserted into the image by introducing the corresponding Huffman codewords. At the receiver's side, the hidden data can be extracted by referring to the pre-defined table without the need to decrypt the image. To restore the image, the decrypted JPEG image is segmented using the Superpixel function, and further processed using the prediction algorithm for recovering the removed AC coefficients. Experimental results show the recovered images resemble their original counterparts.

	<p class="abstract">Abstract: <i>This paper proposes a novel reversible unified information hiding method for the JPEG compressed image, aiming to achieve scrambling and external data insertion simultaneously. The properties of DC coefficients, energy of AC coefficient block, and run of zero AC coefficients are exploited. Two techniques are proposed to degrade the perceptual quality while manipulating the DCT coefficients for data embedding. Most of the existing unified information hiding methods are designed to operate in the spatial domain and their direct application to the compressed domain such as JPEG will lead to large bitstream size increment. Thus, the proposed techniques aim to minimize the bitstream size increment while offering comparable performance with respect to the current state-of-the-art methods. Experiments are conducted to measure the performance of the proposed unified method by using the UCID (Uncompressed Color Image Database) database and standard test images. Results suggest that the effective data payload ranging from 32 to 10238 bits and SSIM value ranging from 0.0548 to 0.9432 are achieved for the UCID database.

	<p class="abstract">Abstract: <i>In this work, a format-compliant encryption method with the data embedding feature for JPEG compressed image is proposed. First, DC coefficients are encoded based on the regions induced by the textural information carried by AC coefficients. Second, AC coefficients are scanned in eight different orders and the order that results in the smallest bitstream size is selected. Next, AC coefficients from each block are extracted in the form of Run/Size and Value, and manipulated to significantly increase the scope of permutation. Then the virtual queue decomposition is proposed to embed external information. All the processes are completely reversible where the embedded information can be extracted and the original content can be perfectly reconstructed from its processed counterpart. The performance of the proposed method is verified through experiments using various standard test images and the UCID dataset. The proposed method is also compared against the conventional format-compliant encryption methods, where its superiority in terms of robustness against sketch attacks, suppression of bitstream size increment, and data embedding are highlighted.

	<p class="abstract">Abstract: <i>This paper proposes a novel reversible information hiding method aiming to achieve scalable carrier capacity while progressively distorting the image quality. Unlike the conventional methods, the proposed method HAM (Histogram Association Mapping) purposely degrades the perceptual quality of the input image through data embedding. To the best of our knowledge, there is no method that attempts to significantly increase the carrier capacity while introducing (tolerating) intentional perceptual degradation for avoiding unauthorized viewing. HAM eliminates the expensive pre-processing step(s) required by the conventional histogram shifting data embedding approach and improves its carrier capacity. In particular, the host image is divided into non-overlapping blocks and each block is classified into two classes. Each class undergoes different HAM process to embed the external data while distorting quality of the image to the desired level. Experiments were conducted to measure the performances of the proposed method by using standard test images and CalTech 101 dataset. In the best case scenario, an average of ~2.88 bits per pixel is achieved as the effective carrier capacity for the CalTech 101 dataset. The proposed method is also compared with the conventional methods in terms of carrier capacity and scalability in perceptual quality degradation.</i></p>

	<p class="abstract">Abstract: <i>This paper proposes a novel rotational method on AC coefficient pairs to embed data into a JPEG compressed image.

The coefficients are first grouped into pairs and then rotated to the left or right directions to create distinctive states, where each can be utilized to represent external data. The AC coefficients are not modified and no additional AC coefficients are introduced for data embedding. However, preprocessing is needed so that all blocks satisfy the properties assumed to ensure correct data extraction and image recovery. The proposed method is rewritable because the host image can be re-utilized without causing further distortion. Experiments were conducted to verify the basic performance of the proposed method.

The main cause of bitstream size increment in ScaScraIH is storing the number of nonzero coefficients in each 8 × 8 block which is utilized during the descrambling process. This paper proposes two techniques in suppressing bitstream size increment for ScaScraIH. The first technique exploits the distribution of nonzero DCT coefficients in the image to construct a scanning order, aiming to shorten the distance between nonzero coefficients in a block. For the second technique, combination of predictive and entropy coding is used to encode the number of nonzero coefficients. Experiments are conducted by using standard test images to verify the effectiveness of both techniques in suppressing bitstream size increment. On average, bitstream size increment is significantly suppressed to ~0.91%, with some of the processed images assuming smaller bitstream size than its original counter part.</i></p>

	<p class="abstract">Abstract: <i>This paper proposes a scalable data representation scheme to improve the carrier capacity of a data hiding method called ScaScraIH [1] in the DCT compressed domain. Though ScaScraIH can scalably scramble a DCT compressed content such as JPEG image and MPEG/H.26x video while inserting external information into it, the manipulated content suffers from consistent bitstream size increment. To better justify the inevitable bitstream size increment, we propose a data representation scheme called virtual queue decomposition to scalably increase the carrier capacity of ScaScraIH without further increasing bitstream size of the output product. Virtual queue decomposition puts zerorun-value pairs into a fixed number of sub-queues, where the cardinality of each sub-queue together form a unique decomposition that encodes a segment of the external information. Carrier capacity is increased by simply increasing the number of sub-queues, but at the expense of higher computational complexity. Analysis is carried out to compute the theoretical upper bound for carrier capacity with respect to ScaScraIH. Experiments are also carried out to verify the proposed improvement.</i></p>
