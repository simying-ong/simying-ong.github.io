<p>I am currently a Senior Lecturer in <a href="https://fsktm.um.edu.my/">Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technology (UM)</a>, <a href="https://www.um.edu.my/">University of Malaya</a>, Malaysia. Before I joined <abbr title="University of Malaya">UM</abbr> on year 2018, I was lecturing in <a href="https://university.taylors.edu.my/en.html">Taylor's University Malaysia</a> and <a href="https://www.tarc.edu.my/">Tunku Abdul Rahman University College Malaysia</a>. 

<p><abbr title="University of Malaya">UM</abbr> always has its special place in heart because it was my home university. I completed my Bachelor Degree of Computer Science (Software Engineering) and Doctor of Philosophy (Information Security) in <abbr title="University of Malaya">UM</abbr>. Besides, it is one of the reputable and well-established government universities in Malaysia, which producing numerous top-end researches in the country.

<p>I was a first class student when I was doing my <abbr title="Bachelor of Computer Science (Software Engineering)">BCS(SE)</abbr> many years ago. That was probably because coding is one of my past and current (still) enthusiasms in my life. I enjoy breaking problems into small sub-problems (divide and conquer), and solve them, programmatically (and logically). 

<p>After I completed my first degree, I was given an opportunity to further pursue a postgraduate study. I tried to work on Data Grid researches before I found my true research passion - <b>Information Hiding</b>.

<p>I worked with my Ph.D. supervisor, Dr. KokSheik Wong (currently <abbr title="Associate Professor">AP</abbr> in Monash University Malaysia). He is an <abbr title="Information Hiding">IH</abbr> expert. During my 4.5 years of Ph.D. study, we worked together in several researches about this area, which at the same time allowing me to learn image, signal and video processing. This is because before we are able to embed data into a certain cover (which can be image, signal, video or other medium), we must master the domain first to avoid high distortion and breaking statistical properties of the domain, which may end up producing a bunch of random data (that is not able to be displayed in common viewer).   

<p>During my Ph.D, I was very focus in solving certain technical problems in <abbr title="Information Hiding">IH</abbr>. After graduation, I gradually able to see a bigger picture or bigger problems (or needs) in the <abbr title="Information Hiding">IH</abbr> community. Therefore, most of my current researches are in these directions: <b>(i) redesigning common image processing techniques to accomodate data embedding, (ii) extending my previous researches which aims to produce higher performance than the <abbr title="State-of-the-art">SOTA</abbr>s</b>, and <b>(iii) integrating newer knowledge/technology/field (such as AI) in information hiding</b>. 

<p>In this website, I will share my researches in information hiding and image/signal processing. Besides, I will also share some personal thoughts/views about some topics-of-my-interests in researches. I always welcome constructive comments/suggestions, questions and possible research collaborations (<b>simying.ong@um.edu.my</b>).
